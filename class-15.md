## Charles Duhigg “What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team”, New York Times, 2016

Business schools emphasize team based learning to respond to demands of job market.  

A couple of years ago, Google decided to focus on building the perfect team. In 2012, they started Project Aristotle, to study hundreds of Google’s teams.    

In 2008, a group of psychologists worked on figuring out if there is a collective IQ that emerges within a team that is distinct from the intelligence of any single member. What distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. Members spoke in roughly same proportions, and they had high social sensitivity (reading nonverbal cues). This conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity create psychological safety - an environment were people are respected, trusted and comfortable being themselves. 
There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability, but psychological safety was on the top.

In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs. These emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel can’t be optimized.
