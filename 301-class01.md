## jQuery, Events, and the DOM

**jQuery** - a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages, it offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JS tasks quickly and consistently

- Finding elements using CSS-style selectors    
`$(‘li.hot’)`

- Doing something with the elements using jQuery methods    
`$(‘li.hot’).addClass(‘complete’);`     

No need for fallback code.    
Methods affect all the selected elements, without the need to loop through each one.      

Include the jQuery script before the closing `</body>` tag.    
Include a second JavasScript file that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML.     

**minification** - unnecessary spaces, carriage returns, and comments are stripped from the code; resulting in much smaller file.    

jQuery makes coding simpler. *Write less, do more*.    

jQuery has methods that offer simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as:
- loop through elements.     
- add/remove elements from the DOM tree.    
- handle events.    
- fade elements into/out of view.    
- handle Ajax request.    

**Feature detection** - to find the best way to achieve a task, involves the use of many conditional statements.   

A matched set / jQuery selection   
-> When you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is returned.

`var content = $(‘li).html();`        
When you use the .html method to retrieve information, it will return the content of the the first element in the matched set.

`$(‘li’).html(‘Updated’); `    
If you use .html method to update the element, it will replace the content of each element in the matched set

**Implicit iteration** - the ability to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection.     

**Chaining** - the process of placing several methods in the same selector      

`.ready` method
-> checks that the page is ready for your code to work with.   

.html and() .text() both retrieve and update the content of elements.     

Updating elements:    
.html()   
.text()   
.replaceWith()   
.remove()    

Inserting elements:    
- create the new elements in a jQuery object.    
- Use a method to insert the content into the page.     

.before()    
.after()    
.prepend()    
.append()   

Getting and setting attribute values:    
.attr()   
.removeAttr()   
.addClass    
.removeClass()    

.css -> lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties         

`.each()` method
- gets information from each element in the matched set    
- performs a series of actions on each of the elements    
It takes one parameter: a function. You can access the current element using `this`.    
`$(this)` creates a new jQuery selection containing the current element.     

*Event methods:*   

`.on()` - handles all events.   
Some of the events:     
focus, blur, change, input, keydown, keyup, keypress, click dblclick, mouseup, mousedown, mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, hover, submit, select, scroll.    


Ways to include jQuery in your page:     
CDN - Content Delivery Network - a series of servers spread out around the world.    
Protocol relative URL -> starting with two forward slashes `//`
