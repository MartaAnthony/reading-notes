## Database normalization

**Database normalization** - process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.    

Reasons to normalize a database:    
- to minimize duplicate data   
- to minimize or avoid data modification issues  
- to simplify queries  

Duplicated information poses 2 problems:    
- it increases storage and decrease performance     
- it becomes more difficult to maintain data changes   
 
3 forms of database normalization:
1NF, 2NF, 3NF   

**First Normal Form** - information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.    
**Second Normal Form** - the table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.    
**Third Normal Form** - the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
