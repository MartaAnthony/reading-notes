## SQL

**SQL - Structured Query Language** - is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.    

**A relational database** represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

**Queries** - SELECT statements, which declare what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.     

`SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;`

All data:    
`SELECT *          
FROM mytable;`       

WHERE clause - to filter certain results           
`WHERE condition   
    AND/OR another_condition   
    AND/OR …;`   

All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.    

Unique results: `DISTINCT`   
Ordering: `ORDER BY`    
Limiting results to a subset: `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`
