## Call stack

**Call stack** - mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.    

**Stack overflow** - an error resulting from stack taking more space that it has been assigned.     

Javascript engine comprises of a heap and a single heap stack. The browser provides web APIs such as DOM and AJAX.    

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.    

In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.     

Call stack is a data structure that uses LIFO (Last In First Out) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.
