## Images in CSS

You can control size of images in CSS.   
You can use float property to align images. It is common to add margin so the images donâ€™t touch.    

Images are inline elements. To center an image, you need to turn it into a block-level element using the display property.   

Images can become background.    

You can create a link or button that changes to a second style when the user moves their mouse over, and a third style when they click.
