## Big O notation 


**Big O notation** - describes the execution time required to the space used by an algorithm. 

Common orders of growth:  

`O(1)` - algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.   
`O(N)` - algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion two the size of the input data set.   
`O(N²)` - algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set, common in algorithms with nested iterations.   
`O(2n)` - algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
