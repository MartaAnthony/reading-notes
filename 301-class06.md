APIs continued

***“How I explained REST to my brother”***

**Roy Fielding** - computer scientist, originator of REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style, co-founder of the Apache HTTP Server project. Helped write the first servers.    

**Http** and what follows can describe the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It’s the foundation of the web.    

A web page is a representation of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs tell the browsers that there is a resource somewhere. Then the browser asks for the web representation of a concept.     

APIs could be a resource representation as well. Machines could use web like people do, and send messages back and forth to each other.    

**Polymorphism** - different nouns have the same verb applied to them. Http protocol is about applying verbs to nouns. The browser does an HTTP GET on the URL and back comes a webpage.     


*SuperAgent* - ajax API, works with Node.js.
