## Responsive web design

### Shay Howeâ€™s introduction

**RWD** - the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size; focused on providing an intuitive experience for everyone.
It favors design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way.    
The term was coined by *Ethan Marcotte*.    

Responsive Web Design:
- flexible layouts   
- media queries   
- flexible media   

**Flexible layouts** - building the layout of the website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.They use percentages or ems.

CSS3 - new relative length units: vw, vh, vmin, vmax.   
`vw` viewports width   
`vh` viewport height   
`vmin` minimum of the viewport height and width  
`vmax` maximum of the viewport height and width   

Relative width of the target element = target width of an element divided by its parent element   
`Target / context = result`

**Media queries** - provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation.    
`@media` rule in the existing style sheet      

types:    
- all   
- screen   
- print   
- tv   
- braille   
- 3d-glasses   

Logical operators: and, not, only.    

Media features -> identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression.   
`min-width`
`max-width`
`orientation`: portrait or landscape  
`aspect-ratio`, `device-aspect-ratio`
`pixel-ratio`, `device-pixel-ratio` -> for identifying high-definition devices, like retina displays.    
`resolution` -> in DPI (dots per inch).   
Other media features: color, color-index, monochrome, scan.     

**Mobile first** - using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.    
* avoid CSS3 shadows, gradients, transforms and animations in mobile.  

viewport - meta tag
scale - minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, user-scalable, between 0 and 10.     
user-scalable=yes -> allows user to zoom    
`@viewport` CSS rule has been recently introduced, but is not supported by all the browsers.    

**Flexible Media**
To get embedded media responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have width of 100%, and height of 0.  

### All about floats 
#### CSS-Tricks

**Float** - CSS positioning property.    
Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page.   
Used:
- to wrap text around images    
- to create entire web layouts (but Flexbox and Grid are better tools to do that)    

`clear`     
the element will not move up adjacent to the float   

The great collapse -> if a parent element contains nothing but floats, the height of it collapses to nothing. We fix it by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.     

Techniques for clearing the floats:    
- the empty div method    
- the overflow method   
- the easy clearing method -> apply new class and the pseudo-selector `:after`
