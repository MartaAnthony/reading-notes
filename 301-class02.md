## Mustache and Flexbox

*Javascript templating* is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 

*Mustache* is logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, or source code.

**mustache.js** is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. 

`Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });`     
*// returns: Hello, Sherlynn*

two braces {{}} mean that it is a placeholder.

## Flexbox

**FLexbox layout** ->  a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container. It gives the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. It is direction-agnostic. 

*(Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts. Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts).*

Properties for the Parent (flex container):
- display     
- flex-direction   
- flex-wrap   
- flex-flow   
- justify-content   
- align-items

Properties for the Children (flex items):    
- order.    
- flex-grow    
- flex-shrink    
- flex-basis   
- flex   
- align-self
