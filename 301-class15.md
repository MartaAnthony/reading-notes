## Diversity and inclusion


*- from Quartz “Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago” by T.L.Andrews, February 2017*

11 out of 25 best-paying jobs are technology related  

Early computers were used for game playing, and they were aimed at boys and men. An 1985 study showed that 75% of men were using computers on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women. 

In 1983, US experienced a video game recession, caused by the flood of low quality games and the resulting loss of confidence from consumers. Marketers tried to revive the industry by marketing to the audience they had left which were boys. Advertisers were selling games to boys because boys were buying them, and boys were buying them because they were marketed to them. It was no coincidence that the console that saved the gaming industry was called “Game Boy”.

Girls didn’t have experience with computers and programming languages, and so they were left behind by the time they got to college. More early exposure to engineering and computing creates more positive attitudes toward STEM. 

Even when women have a lot of experience with coding and math, male-dominated environment is an obstacle for entry to many. The few women who get into the field are far less likely to stay than their male counterparts. Almost the third of women want to quit during their first year.
