## Local Storage

Ideally, we want:   
*a lot of storage space 
on the client  
that persists beyond a page refresh    
and isn’t transmitted to the server* 

**Web storage**, sometimes known as **DOM storage** provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header. There are two main web storage types: local storage and session storage, behaving similarly to persistent cookies and session cookies respectively.     

**HTML5 storage** - a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server.     

From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the `localStorage` object on the global window object.    

Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets.     

If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event.
