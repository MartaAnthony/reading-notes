## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

Pure functions:    
- it returns the same result if given the same arguments,    
- it does not cause any observable side effects (for example modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference),    
- the code’s easier to test.         

**Immutability** - data’s state cannot change after it’s created      

**Referential transparency** - if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input .   

`Pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

Functions as first-class entities - also treated as values and used as data. They can:     
- refer to it from constants and variables   
- pass it as a parameter to other functions    
- return it as result from other functions.    

Higher-order functions are the ones who either:    
- take one or more functions as arguments, or
- return a function as its result.
