### Sending form data

**Client/server architecture**
A client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server, using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.       

The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are `action` and `method.` 

`action` - defines where the data is sent    
`method` - defines how the data is sent (most common ate GET and POST)     

HTTP request consists of two parts:       
- header - a set of global metadata about the browser’s capabilities 
- body - information necessary for the server to perform the request    

`GET` - data appended to a URL    
`POST` - data included in the request body (better for large amount of data and passwords)    

**Sending files**   
Files are binary data, and all other data is text data. Because HTTP is a text protocol, there are special requirements for handling binary data.     
1. set the method attribute to `POST`  
2. set the value of `enctype` to `multipart/form-data`  
3. include one or more `<input type=“file”>` control    

**Security** -> Be paranoid, never trust your users.   
1. Escape potentially dangerous characters
2. Limit the incoming amount of data
3. Sandbox uploaded data
