## Node.js

**Node.js** is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it is a JavaScript runtime.  

**V8** is the open-source Javascript engine that runs on Google Chrome.   

**npm** - node package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It is also a software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.    

To check Node is installed: `node -v`    

Installing a package globally:      
`npm install -g jshint`     

Installing a package locally:     
`npm init -y` - this wil create and auto populate a package.json file.      

Uses:    
- installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application;   
- running JavaScript on the server

Node.js is **event-driven** - everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.    

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some sort of real-life interaction or collaboration, for example chat sites.     

Advantages:    
- speed   
- scalability    
- used on a web server   
- you can do everything in the same language     
- it speaks json     
- JavaScript is ubiquitous
